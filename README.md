# 🐘 HOW TO COMPILE
- This repo currently only has the source code, i'm going to add a compiled release sometime in the future, to compile the mod yourself you can open the repo in IntelliJ, click on the Gradle icon on the right,
  go into Tasks>build and double-click build, then you should find a .jar file in <wynnarsch folder>/build/libs
